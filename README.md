# Thermal Resoluation of Unblocking Temperatures (TROUT)
The Thermal Resolution of Unblocking Temperatures (TROUT) method is used to seperate overlapping components in thermal and alternating field demagnetization data.

TROUT makes use of the packages `numpy` `scipy` `matplotlib` `pandas` `jax` `sklearn` `emcee` and `pmagpy`, install these packages using pip to run the code.
The TROUT figures from the paper (in prep) can be reproduced using the jupyter notebook. This also provides examples of how to run the functions from the TROUT.py module.

This code is a work in progress and updates to optimization the code are liable to occur. Sorry if this breaks something.
